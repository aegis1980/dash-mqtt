# Dash MQTT

`dash_mqtt` is a Dash component library for adding MQTT messaging functionality to your Dash apps.
It is essentially a wrapper around [MQTT.js](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js).

**Instructions below largely from [Dash boiler plate code](https://github.com/plotly/dash-component-boilerplate/blob/master/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_shortname%7D%7D/README.md#create-a-production-build-and-publish)**

Get started with:
1. Install Dash and its dependencies: https://dash.plotly.com/installation
2. Run `python usage.py`
3. Visit http://localhost:8050 in your web browser


### Install dependencies

If you have selected install_dependencies during the prompt, you can skip this part.

1. Install npm packages
    ```
    $ npm install
    ```
2. Create a virtual env and activate.
    ```
    $ virtualenv venv
    $ . venv/bin/activate
    ```
    _Note: venv\Scripts\activate for windows_

3. Install python packages required to build components.
    ```
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Install the python packages for testing (optional)
    ```
    $ pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
    ```

### Write your component code in `src/lib/components/DashMqtt.react.js`.

- The demo app is in `src/demo` and you will import your example component code into your demo app.
- Test your code in a Python environment:
    1. Build your code
        ```
        $ npm run build
        ```
    2. Run and modify the `usage.py` sample dash app:
        ```
        $ python usage.py
        ```
- Write tests for your component.
    - A sample test is available in `tests/test_usage.py`, it will load `usage.py` and you can then automate interactions with selenium.
    - Run the tests with `$ pytest tests`.
    - The Dash team uses these types of integration tests extensively. Browse the Dash component code on GitHub for more examples of testing (e.g. https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components)
- Add custom styles to your component by putting your custom CSS files into your distribution folder (`dash_mqtt`).
    - Make sure that they are referenced in `MANIFEST.in` so that they get properly included when you're ready to publish your component.
    - Make sure the stylesheets are added to the `_css_dist` dict in `dash_mqtt/__init__.py` so dash will serve them automatically when the component suite is requested.
- [Review your code](./review_checklist.md)

### Create a production build and publish:

1. Build your code:
    ```
    $ npm run build
    ```
2. Create a Python distribution
    ```
    $ pip install wheels
    ```
    then, 
    ```
    $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    ```
    This will create source and wheel distribution in the generated the `dist/` folder.
    See [PyPA](https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#packaging-your-project)
    for more information.

3. Test your wheels file by copying it into a new environment and installing it locally:
    ```
    $ pip install dash_mqtt-<version>-py3-none-any.whl
    ```

4. If it works, then make a pull request to [github repo](https://github.com/aegis1980/dash-mqtt)
